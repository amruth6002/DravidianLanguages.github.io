        <p>Dravidian languages are a family of languages spoken mainly in southern India and parts of northeastern Sri
            Lanka. They are believed to have originated in the region known as the Dravidian belt, which includes the
            states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh in India, as well as the northern and eastern
            parts of Sri Lanka. The Dravidian language family is one of the world's major language families, comprising
            around 80 languages, though the number of major Dravidian languages is much smaller.

            The major Dravidian languages include:

            Tamil: Spoken predominantly in the state of Tamil Nadu in India and northern and eastern Sri Lanka. It is
            one of the oldest languages in the world with a rich literary tradition spanning over two millennia.

            Telugu: Predominantly spoken in the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It is one of the most
            spoken Dravidian languages.

            Kannada: Mainly spoken in the Indian state of Karnataka. Kannada has a rich literary heritage and is one of
            the oldest Dravidian languages.

            Malayalam: The principal language of the Indian state of Kerala and the union territory of Lakshadweep.
            Malayalam shares many linguistic features with Tamil.

            Tulu: Spoken mainly in the coastal districts of Karnataka and in parts of northern Kerala. It has fewer
            speakers compared to the other major Dravidian languages.

            Toda: Spoken by the Toda people in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the smaller
            Dravidian languages with a limited number of speakers.

            Kodava: Spoken by the Kodava people in the Kodagu district of Karnataka, India. It is also known as Coorgi
            and has a relatively small number of speakers.

            These languages share common features such as agglutination (the combination of morphemes into words by
            adding affixes) and the use of suffixes to indicate grammatical relationships. They have a rich literary
            tradition and have contributed significantly to the cultural heritage of South India and Sri Lanka.</p>
